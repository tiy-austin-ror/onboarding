        <ul>
          <li>All assignments are due at 8am before class begins (unless otherwise noted)</li>
          <li>No assignments should include <strong>copy and pasted</strong> code</li>
          <li>No assignments should include code lifted or ‘borrowed’ from someone else without proper citation and licensing</li>
          <li>Incomplete homework is better than late homework</li>
          <li>Late homework is better than no homework</li>
          <li>Asking for clarify or help on assignments is encouraged</li>
          <li>Turning in code that you do not understand is <strong>hightly</strong> discouraged and should be noted so we can address those issues. We, as developers, need to be able to explain our code to others and we cannot do that if we do not understand it ourselves.</li>
